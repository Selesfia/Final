```
import cv2

# Read an image from file
image = cv2.imread('bg2.jpg') #name of the file that want to be process

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply Gaussian blur to the image
blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray_image, (5, 5), 0)

# Perform edge detection on the blurred image
edges = cv2.Canny(blurred_image, 50, 150)

# Display the original image and processed image
cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
cv2.imshow('Edges', edges)

Make sure to install the OpenCV library using pip install opencv-python before running this code. 
The code uses the imread function to read an image from a file, cvtColor function to convert the image to grayscale, 
GaussianBlur function to apply blur, and Canny function to perform edge detection.

The example code reads an image from a file, converts it to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur, and performs edge detection using the Canny algorithm. 
Finally, it displays the original image and the detected edges.
